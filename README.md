 
 # NeoVim config.

 ### There are many things that are probably not ideal:
 
 - At some point I would like to refactor plugins into their own ```/plugins``` folder.
 - I am probably the only person who should be using this. The config is vey basic and is made to fit my needs. Because of this, this config is probably really ugly. I plan to clean it up at some point, but for now this works for me.
